Pagination Calculation & Logic

Logic:
const companiesPerPage = 10;
const totalCompanies = 27;

for (let currentPage = 0; currentPage < Math.ceil(totalCompanies / companiesPerPage); currentPage++) {
  const indexOfLastCompany = (currentPage + 1) * companiesPerPage;
  const indexOfFirstCompany = indexOfLastCompany - companiesPerPage;

  // Slice the companies array to get the companies for the current page
  const companiesOnCurrentPage = companies.slice(indexOfFirstCompany, indexOfLastCompany);

  console.log(`Page ${currentPage + 1}:`, companiesOnCurrentPage);
}


Calculation:
To display 10 companies per page when you have a total of 27 companies, you can calculate which companies will appear on each page using the pagination logic you provided. Here's how it works:

1. Variables
Total Companies: 27
Companies Per Page: 10
2. Calculations for Each Page
Page 1 (currentPage = 0):

indexOfLastCompany = (0 + 1) * 10 = 10
indexOfFirstCompany = 10 - 10 = 0
Companies displayed: Companies 0 to 9
Page 2 (currentPage = 1):

indexOfLastCompany = (1 + 1) * 10 = 20
indexOfFirstCompany = 20 - 10 = 10
Companies displayed: Companies 10 to 19
Page 3 (currentPage = 2):

indexOfLastCompany = (2 + 1) * 10 = 30
indexOfFirstCompany = 30 - 10 = 20
Companies displayed: Companies 20 to 26
Summary of Pages
Page 1: Companies 0 to 9 (10 companies)
Page 2: Companies 10 to 19 (10 companies)
Page 3: Companies 20 to 26 (7 companies, as there are only 7 left)
